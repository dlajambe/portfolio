# My Portfolio Website

## Description

This project was used to create my personal software development and machine learning portfolio website.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

All that is required is Python and a package manager such as Virtualenv or Conda. The required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To view the website, a browser is required.

### Installation

To install, simply clone the repository onto your machine and use your package manager to recreate the environment with the provided `requirements.txt` file. If you have Anaconda or Miniconda, you can instead use the `environment.yml` to reproduce the environment.

### Execution

The website can be started locally through the command line. With your virtual environment activated, navigate to the `portfolio/` directory and execute the following command: 
```
python main.py
```
